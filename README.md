# Cmake-playground

Welcome to **Cmake-playground**! 🎉  

This repository is my personal sandbox for **learning CMake**, experimenting with builds, and having some fun along the way. Everything here is just for exploration, testing ideas, and improving my C++ project-building skills.  

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **learning space**, so expect messy code, experiments that break, and lots of trial-and-error.

## 🧩 Purpose

- **Learn CMake**: Explore commands, targets, build types, and more.  
- **Experiment Freely**: Try things out without worrying about production-ready code.  
- **Reference for Myself**: Keep tips, snippets, and tricks for future projects.  
- **Fun**: Because learning should be enjoyable 😎

## ⚡ Features

- Minimal CMake examples for personal learning
- Build configuration testing (Debug/Release)
- Experimenting with modern CMake best practices
- Playground for trying out external libraries and dependencies
